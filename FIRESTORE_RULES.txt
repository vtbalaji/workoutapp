Firestore Security Rules for Workout App
==========================================

Go to Firebase Console → fitness-coach-20c20 → Firestore Database → Rules

Replace the rules with:

---

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow users to read/write their own workouts
    match /workouts/{userId}/userWorkouts/{workoutId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Deny all other access
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}

---

These rules ensure:
- Each user can only access their own workouts (userId must match their authenticated UID)
- Workouts are organized in: /workouts/{userId}/userWorkouts/{workoutId}
- All other database access is denied
- Your sections and exercises are stored within each workout document
