Bend the right knee, open your pelvis to the sky, and shift your weight into your left hand as you rotate to the outer edge of your left foot. As your right foot touches the floor, lift your right arm up and reach it overhead. Lift your hips toward the sky and relax your neck. Hold the pose and take slow, deep breaths. Carefully rotate your body to the left to return to Downward Facing Dog. Change sides. Avoid this pose if you have shoulder or wrist injury.
