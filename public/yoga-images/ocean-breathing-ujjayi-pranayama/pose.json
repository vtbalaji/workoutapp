  "description": "Sit in a comfortable position. Lengthen your spine. Rest your hands on your knees. Close your eyes. Open your mouth. As you exhale, contract your throat and make a ‘hhhaaa’ sound, as if you were fogging a mirror. It should sound like a soft whisper. Now close your mouth and breathe through your nose only, but continue making this ‘hhhaaa’ sound with each inhale and exhale. Repeat 10 rounds of this breath. Keep chin parallel to floor Slightly constrict the throat Modification: Place a firm cushion or rolled mat under your bottom to bring more length to your spine.
