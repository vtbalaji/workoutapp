Hold the pose and take slow, deep breaths. Lower with an exhale. Carefully release your legs. Repeat with the other leg on top. Modification: Even if your buttocks don’t lift from the floor, build strength by pushing your hands into the floor and engaging your core. Avoid this pose if you have sciatica, knee issues or wrist injury.",
