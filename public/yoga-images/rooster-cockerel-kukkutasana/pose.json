  "description": "Begin in Lotus. Rock back onto your buttocks and thread your hands in between your calves and thighs. Your elbows should stay above your legs. Place your palms on the floor. Roll forward and lift your hips with an inhale to balance on your hands. Steady your gaze a few feet in front of you. Hold the pose and breathe normally. Lower with an exhale and uncross your legs. Repeat with the other leg on top. Modification: Balance in the pose for a few seconds and gradually work toward a longer hold. Avoid this pose if you have high blood pressure, back pain or hernia.
