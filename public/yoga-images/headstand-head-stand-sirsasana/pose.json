  "description": "How to perform Headstand / Head Stand Begin kneeling and place your elbows on the floor. Clasp the outsides of your elbows with opposite hands. Release your hands but don’t move your elbows– keep this distance throughout the pose. Interlace your fingers and place the pinky fingers on the floor. Place the part of your head that’s just behind your hairline on the floor. Cup the back of your head with your hands. Curl your toes under, straighten your legs and walk your feet in toward you. With an inhale bring one knee into your chest, then the other. Straighten your legs toward the sky with an exhale. Fix your gaze at one point to balance. Press your elbows and wrists into the floor. Hold the pose and take slow, deep breaths. Lower your legs to the floor one at a time with an exhale. Rest in Extended Child’s Pose for 30 seconds. Draw shoulder blades toward sky",
