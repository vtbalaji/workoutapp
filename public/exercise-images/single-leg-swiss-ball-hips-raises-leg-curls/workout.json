Squeeze your glutes and raise your right leg off the ball until it is in line with your left thigh. Push your hips up to form a straight line with your body. Pull your left heel towards you and roll the ball as close to your buttocks as possible. Roll the ball back to starting position, lower your right leg and alternate to the left leg.",
