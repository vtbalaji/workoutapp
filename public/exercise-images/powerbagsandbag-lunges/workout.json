  "description": "Hold the powerbag/sandbag against your chest with your arms curled around it from the under side. Take one step forward (around 1.5 times a normal forward step). Lower your body into the lunge until the forward leg reaches a 90-degree angle bend. Your back knee should only just hover from the floor. Push upwards through the front leg and drive your body back to the starting position.",
