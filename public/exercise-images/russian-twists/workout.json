Raise your upper body from the mat to form V-shape with your thighs. Keep your arms fully extended in front of your chest, clasping your hands together.This is the start position. In a smooth motion, twist your upper body to the right until you feel a stretch in your back and sides. Keep your arms parallel to the floor and exhale as you do this. Hold for a count of one and inhale. Return to the start position while breathing out. Repeat the movement,this time to the left side of your body. As your strength increases, you can hold a weight plate or medicine ball in front of you to increase resistance and engage other muscle groups.",
