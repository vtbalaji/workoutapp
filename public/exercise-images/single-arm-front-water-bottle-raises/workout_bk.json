  "description": "Stand straight holding a water bottle in each hand with an overhand grip. Hold the water bottles in front of your thighs with your palms of the facing your thighs. Keep your arms fully extended. This is the start position. Raise the left water bottle out and upwards, while keeping a slight bend in your elbow. Your palms must always face down for this exercise. Continue raising the water bottle until your arm is a little above parallel to the floor. Exhale as you are raising the water bottle. Pause for a count of one. Inhale and slowly lower the water bottle to the start position. As you lower the left water bottle, begin to lift the right water bottle, duplicating the movement. When both water bottles have been raised and lowered in a cycle, that is one repetition.",
