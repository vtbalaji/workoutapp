  "description": "Begin to squat by flexing your hips and knees, lowering your hips between your legs. Maintain an upright, straight back as you descend as low as you can. At the bottom, reverse direction and stand by extending your knees and hips and pushing down through your heels. As you do so, press both kettlebells overhead by extending your arms straight up, using the momentum from the squat to help drive the weights upward. As you begin the next repetition, return the weights to the shoulders.",
