  "description": "Place a Swiss Ball on the ground and lie face down in front of it. With your hands beneath your shoulders, push yourself up into a classic Push-Up position. With a tight core, place one foot on the Swiss Ball. Once you feel balanced, position the other foot on the ball as well. Maintaining a braced core and a flat back, slowly lower your upper body towards the floor. Focus all of the tension into your chest. Your feet will remain on the ball, fighting for balance during the movement. Push yourself back into the starting position before beginning again.",
