  "description": "Begin the movement by stepping on to a resistance band with your feet at shoulder-width, toes pointed slightly out. Push the handles of the band overhead while keeping a slight bend in the elbow. Brace your abdominals and do not arch your back. Slowly lower your hands behind your head using only the forearms. The upper arms will stay in place with the elbow pointed up. Push the handles back up, focusing the tension in the triceps.",
