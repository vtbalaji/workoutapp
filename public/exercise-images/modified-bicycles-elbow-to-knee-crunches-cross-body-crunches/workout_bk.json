  "title": "Modified Bicycles / Elbow-to-Knee Crunches / Cross-body Crunches",
  "description": "Lie flat on an exercise mat on the floor keeping your lower back straight with no arching of your spine and with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Place your hands lightly on the sides of your head. Curl your torso upwards so your shoulders are slightly raised off the floor. Raise one knees until your thigh is at a right angle to the floor and your calf is parallel to the floor. At the same time, bring the opposite elbow across your body until it meets with the raised knee. After each crunch, return to the start position inhaling as you do so, bringing your foot back down to the ground",
