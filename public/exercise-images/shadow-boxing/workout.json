  "description": "Stand tall with a tight core. Keep your gaze straight ahead. Bring your hands up to shoulder level. Make a tight fist with the thumb on the outside of your hand. Do not wrap your fingers around your thumb. Begin in a left lead stance. Your left foot should be in front. Your right foot should be behind. Throw a left lead jab by extending your left hand straight out in front of you and immediately retracting. Follow up the left jab with a right cross. Twist your foot and drive your right hip forward as you throw a straight punch with your back right hand. Alternate these two punches. Switch sides when finished with the prescribed repetitions.",
