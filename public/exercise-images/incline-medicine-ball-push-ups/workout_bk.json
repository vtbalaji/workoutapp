  "description": "Place a medicine ball on a bench and ensure that there is enough friction for it to stay in place without support. Place your hands on the top of the medicine ball and extend your feet out so that your body is in a fully extended, starting push-up position. Slowly lower your body until your chest lightly touches the medicine ball. Using your chest and triceps push your hands ‘through’ the ball forcing your body to rise back up to the starting position. Contract your pectoral muscles at the top position.",
