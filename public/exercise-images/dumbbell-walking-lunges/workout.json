Drop the back right knee towards the floor and keep the left knee bent. Drive yourself up and take a step forward with your right foot. The left knee will go towards the floor and you’ll bend the right knee. Continue this back and forth pattern. Be sure to keep the abdominals braced during the entire movement.",
