  "description": "Stand tall with a tight core and make sure your feet are shoulder-width apart. Bring your hands together for balance. Step directly to the left, leaving your right foot in place. Bend the left knee and reach down to the floor once the upper left thigh is parallel to the ground. Try to keep you back strong as you reach. Your right leg should be completely straight. Contract the hamstring muscle then push off the ground to return to the starting position. Repeat on the right side.",
