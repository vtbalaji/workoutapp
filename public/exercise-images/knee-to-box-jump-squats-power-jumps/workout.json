  "title": "Knee to Box Jump Squats / Power Jumps",
  "description": "Begin in a kneeling position on the floor with your back straight in front of a sturdy box designed for jump squats. Lower your glutes towards your heels and then explosively jump to your feet by bringing them forward. From the half squat position, drive through your calves, quadriceps, and glutes to perform one squat jump. Make a soft landing by bending your knees as your feet touch down onto the top of the box. You should land on both feet simultaneously. Step down to complete one rep.",
