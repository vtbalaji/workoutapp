  "description": "Lie on your back, either on a mat or comfortable workout surface. Bring your feet together, with your toes pointing upwards. Bring your arms several inches away from your torso, keeping your palms facing up. When ready, begin to bend one knee, lightly sliding your heel along the mat or workout surface. Continue to bend your knee, bringing your heel towards you, until it reaches the level of the straightened knee. Hold briefly, before lightly pushing your heel back, extending the knee, all the way to the starting position.",
