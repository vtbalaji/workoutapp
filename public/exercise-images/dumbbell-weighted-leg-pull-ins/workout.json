  "description": "Stand a dumbbell on one of its plates about 2 feet away from the edge of a bench and sit comfortably on the edge of that bench, using you hand-grip for support. Fully extend your legs towards the dumbbell. Using your amazing foot-eye coordination, pin each foot underneath the top plate of the standing dumbbell, on either side of its bar. Bring your knees in towards your chest, taking care not to drop the dumbbell in the process, and hold them as close as you can to your chest for 1 second. Extend the legs back down towards the floor to the starting position.",
