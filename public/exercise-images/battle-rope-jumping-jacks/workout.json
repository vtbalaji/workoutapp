  "description": "Holding a battle rope in each hand, start with your hands at your sides. Forcefully, push off the ground into a small jump and extend your legs to each side. At the same time, bring the ropes up above your head. Jump again, bringing your feet together, and moving your arms back down towards your hips. Repeat the movement, mimicking a traditional jumping jack.",
