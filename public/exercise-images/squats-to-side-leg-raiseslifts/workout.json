  "description": "Place your feet at shoulder width apart while keeping your chest up and your abdominals braced. Bend at the knees and drive your hips back as if you’re sitting in a chair. Continue to lower your body until your upper legs are parallel to the floor. Then drive your hips forward and push through your quads and glutes  to return to a standing position. Just as you reach the standing position, lift your chosen leg out to the side; it should be straight. Lower your leg back so that you return to the starting position and repeat for the other side!",
