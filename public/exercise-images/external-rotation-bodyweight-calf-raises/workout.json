  "description": "Stand straight with a tight core and flat back and position your feet hip-width apart. Keep your hands at your sides or hold on to a wall for balance. Externally rotate your thighs allowing your toes to turn outward at a 45-degree angle. Focusing the tension in your calf muscles, slowly raise yourself up onto the balls of your feet. Pause at the top of the movement and slowly return to the starting position.",
