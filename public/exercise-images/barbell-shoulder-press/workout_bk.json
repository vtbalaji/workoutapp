  "description": "Place a bench with a back support inside a squat rack and set up a barbell at a height that is just above your head. Grip the barbell with an overhand grip. Space your hands out so that your elbows are bent at 90 degrees. Lift the bar to around shoulder level by extending your arms.  This is the start position. Inhaling, lower the bar  to your shoulders slowly. Hold for a count of one while squeezing your shoulder muscles. Push the barbell back to the start position as you exhaling as you do so.. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",
