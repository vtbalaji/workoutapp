  "description": "Begin standing tall with a tight core. Your chest will be up and your gaze will be straight ahead. Bend at the knees and drive your hips back as you lower yourself into a squat position. Launch yourself up while simultaneously twisting to the other side. Your body will perform a 180 degree turn in midair. Land with bent knees and immediately go right into another jump squat, turning to the starting position. Repeat this alternating pattern.",
