  "description": "Stand tall with your feet together and arms at your sides. Slowly, bend at the hips while keeping your knees engaged. Allow your upper body to hang over. Let your arms drop as well, dangling in front of you. Once you’re fully bent over and your hands are at your toes, pause and feel the stretch in your hamstrings. (Optional: Flatten your back for 5 seconds then return to this position) Once you hold the stretch for up to 30 seconds, return to the starting position.",
