  "title": "Fire Hydrants / Abductor / Adductor Knee Raises",
  "description": "Position yourself on all fours on a mat with your palms flat and shoulder-width apart. Place your knees hip-width apart and bend them at a 90 degree angle. Try to relax your core so that your back and abs are in a natural position. Maintain this posture as you raise your right knee and bring it as close to your chest as you can. Now raise your right thigh out to the side, keeping the hips still. Kick your raised leg straight back slowly until it is in line with your torso. Reverse the movement to return to the starting position.",
