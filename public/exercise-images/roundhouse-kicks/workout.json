  "description": "Stand in a comfortable position with knees slightly bent, one foot forward, at a distance a little wider than shoulder width. Twist your body and simultaneously lift your back leg so that it rotates towards your target, it should be at about hip height. Keeping your back (kicking) leg bent, rotate until your front leg is within close striking distance and then straighten the knee to connect with the target. Connect with your shin lightly, and then reverse the movement, twisting back with your hips to the starting position.",
