  "description": "Place a firm grip on two appropriately weighted dumbbells. Before driving the dumbbells above your head, make sure that your core is tight and your chest is up. Push the dumbbells straight above your head, locking out your elbows. Once you feel stabilized, slowly bend the knees and drive your hips backwards, maintaining a tight, solid core as you do so. Once your upper thighs become parallel with the ground, slowly push back up, returning to the starting position. Be sure to keep those dumbbells fixed overhead throughout the entire movement. This, like all overhead weighted movements, should be performed in a controlled environment. Be sure to check the weight before attempting, if working with an adjustable dumbbell ensure all is locked tightly into place.",
