  "description": "Lie flat on your back with your feet flat on the ground, and your knees bent at 90 degrees. Place your hands flat on top of your thighs. Keep your elbows in  so that they are in line to your body. Push your back down flat into the floor to isolate your abdominal muscles. Gently curl your shoulders forward and up off the floor. Continue to push down into the floor with your lower back. Raise your shoulders about four to six inches only. Hold and squeeze your abdominal muscles at the top of the motion.",
