  "description": "Lie on your side on an exercise mat. Fully extend your legs with one resting on top of the other. Place the hand from your top arm lightly on the side of your head. Bend the arm at floor level to 90 degrees. Your upper arm should be bent at the elbow, while your forearm is at 90 degrees. This is the start position. Lift your body off the ground and balance on your forearm and the side of your foot, while keeping your body in a straight line. Contract your abdominal muscles and relax your shoulders. Twist your body so that your elbow lowers towards the ground. Once the elbow is pointing to the ground, reverse the movement util you are back in the starting position.",
