  "description": "Stand tall holding onto a pole, wall or stationary object for support. Engage your abs as you swing your one leg as far out to the side and then across the stationary leg as you comfortably can. Don’t just let gravity pull the leg – actively use the muscles! Switch sides once you have completed repetitions on the first leg.",
