  "description": "Hold the medicine ball just below your waist and your feet slightly wider than shoulder width apart. Bend your knees, allow your body to lean forward and let the ball hang between your calves. Explode upwards using your legs and bring your arms up holding the medicine ball out in front of you until its just above your head. Lower the ball back between your legs (but not to the floor) and repeat the movement.",
