  "description": "Standing on something soft, such as an exercise mat, place both hands behind your head and gently bring your right knee down to the ground. Follow with your left knee so that you are kneeling on the mat, with your hands behind your head and your back nice and straight. Lift your right knee up placing your right foot in front of you. Bring your left foot forward and drive upward through your right heel to bring you back to starting position. Repeat the same movement, but leading with your left leg.",
