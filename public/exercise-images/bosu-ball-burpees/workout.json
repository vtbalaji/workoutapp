  "description": "Stand with your feet at the side of a flat-top up bosu ball. Place your hands on either side of the bosu ball and apply firm body weight. With the weight transferred to your arms, kick your legs out behind you so that you end up in a starting push-up position. Engaging your core to maintain balance, once again transfer your weight through your arms and hop your feet back to the side of the bosu ball. Take hold of the bosu ball and drive upwards through your glutes, raising the bosu ball above your head. Lower the bosu ball back to the starting position to begin another rep.",
