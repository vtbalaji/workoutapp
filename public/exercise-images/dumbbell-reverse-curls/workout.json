  "description": "Stand holding a dumbbell in each hand using an overhand grip. Your arms should be fully extended and your feet shoulder width apart. This is the starting position. Keeping your upper arms stationary and your back straight, curl the weights up towards your shoulders exhaling as you do so. Use only your forearms for this movement. Continue curling the dumbbells up until they are at shoulder level and your biceps are fully contracted. Hold for a count of one as you squeeze your biceps.. Return to the starting position in a smooth arc, inhaling as you do so. Do not swing your hips or arms to use momentum for this exercise. This exercise can be performed using a barbell, straight bar or E-Z bar attachment connected to the low pulley of a cable station.",
