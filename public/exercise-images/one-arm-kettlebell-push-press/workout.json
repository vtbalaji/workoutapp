  "description": "Hold a kettlebell by the handle. Lift the kettlebell to your shoulder by extending through your legs and hips as you pull the kettlebell towards your shoulder, rotating your wrist as you do so. Your palm should face forward with the kettlebell hanging at the back of your hand. This is the start position. Lower your body by bending your knees while keeping your torso straight and upright. Do not perform a full squat, instead travel down about midway into a squat position. Without pausing, reverse direction, driving down through your heels, to create momentum. As you rise up, press the kettlebell straight up over your head by extending and locking your arms. Land with your knees slightly bent to absorb the impact. Lower the weight to start position",
