  "description": "Standing with a tight core and flat back, hold a pair of dumbbells at your sides. Keeping the dumbbells in a horizontal position, pull them up upwards, leading with your elbows. When your upper arms are parallel with the floor, pause, then flip the dumbbells up. The dumbbells will be above your shoulders next to your head. Press the dumbbells straight up in to the air. Pause and return to the starting position.",
