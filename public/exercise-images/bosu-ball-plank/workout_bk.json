  "description": "Place a BOSU Ball on the ground with the blue rubber side facing up. Carefully, place your elbows on each side of the rubber side. Take a push-up position. Make sure your feet are together, core is tight and hips are level. Brace your body on the BOSU Ball while focusing the entire contraction in your core. Keep hips from dipping by driving them up at a slight angle if you feel yourself dropping. Hold this position for the entire set.",
