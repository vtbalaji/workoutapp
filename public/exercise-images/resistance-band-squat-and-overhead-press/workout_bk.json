  "description": "Begin the movement by stepping on to a resistance band with your feet at shoulder-width, toes pointed slightly out. Bring your hands to your shoulders, keeping the handles of the band behind your shoulders. Brace your core and keep your chest up. Bend first at the knees then at the hips. Lower yourself until your thighs are parallel with the floor. Return to the starting position. When you reach the top, push the resistance bands overhead. Slowly lower your hands and repeat the entire movement.",
