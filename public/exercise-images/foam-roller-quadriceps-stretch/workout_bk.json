  "title": "Foam Roller Quadriceps Stretch",
  "description": "Place a foam roller on the ground and lay on top of it so that the foam roller is supporting your quadriceps (upper part of the leg). Brace your upper body with your elbows. Make sure that the foam roller is positioned near the bottom of the muscle towards the knees but NOT on the knee. You will work your way up towards your hips from here. Slowly move yourself forward allowing your quadriceps to roll 2 to 3 inches on the foam roller. Pause then roll the other way. Continue the back and forth motion. For a deeper stretch, try stacking one leg over the other.",
