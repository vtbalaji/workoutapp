  "description": "Position yourself next to a squat rack or very stable surface. Hold on to this surface with one hand. You may also want to hold a weight plate with the other. This is optional. Make sure your feet are shoulder width apart and have your knees bent slightly. Begin the movement by bending fully at the knees and leaning back. Keep your entire upper body straight all the way down to the knees. Again, use the surface for balance. Once you feel the contraction and burn in your quadriceps, pause and return to the starting position.",
