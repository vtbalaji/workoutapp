Bend the arm at floor level to 90 degrees. Your upper arm should be parallel to your body, while your forearm is at 90 degrees. This is the start position. Lift your body off the ground and balance on your forearm and the side of your foot, while keeping your body in a straight line. Contract your abdominal muscles and relax your shoulders. Continue breathing throughout the whole exercise. Hold this position for as long as you can.",
