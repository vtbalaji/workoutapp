  "description": "Lie flat on an exercise mat on the floor keeping your lower back straight with no arching of your spine and with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Place your hands lightly on the sides of your head. Curl your torso upwards so your shoulders are slightly raised off the floor.. Raise your knees until your thighs are at a right angle to the floor and your calves are parallel to the floor. This is the start position. Slowly move your legs in a pedaling action as if you are riding a bicycle. As you do so, exhale and bring your opposing elbow close to each knee by crunching to one side. Left elbow to right knee. Right elbow to left knee. After each crunch, return to the start position inhaling as you do so. Without pausing, repeat the movement to the other side.",
