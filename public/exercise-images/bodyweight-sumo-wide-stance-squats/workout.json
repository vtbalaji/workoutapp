  "title": "Bodyweight Sumo / Wide Stance Squats",
  "description": "Stand with your feet in a wide stance, with your toes slightly pointed outwards – like a sumo wrestler. Hold your hands together in front of your chest. Keeping your back straight, lower your body towards the ground by bending your knees. As you reach a fully squatting position (legs are bent at a 90-degree angle), hold the pose for 1 second before driving your feet into the floor and slowly push your body back up to the starting position. For a bonus, tense your glutes at the top of the movement.",
