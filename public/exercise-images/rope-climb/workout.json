  "description": "Place your weaker hand 12 inches above your dominant hand on the rope and grip firmly. Using explosive force pull your entire body up the rope, allowing the fold to slide between your feet, and take a new position (similar to the starting position) on the rope. When lowering, do not allow the rope to slide through your hands, this will create a nasty rope burn.",
