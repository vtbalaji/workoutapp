  "description": "Begin the movement by stepping on to a resistance band with your feet at shoulder-width, toes pointed slightly out. Holding the handles of the band in each hand, tighten your abdominals and straighten your lower back. Keep your chest up and gaze forward. Using an underhand grip or hammer fist grip, slowly pull the band towards your shoulders. Keep your upper arm in place, moving only your forearms. Once you reach the top of the movement, pause, and slowly lower the band to the starting position. Do not lock out your elbows.",
