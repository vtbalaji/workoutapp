  "description": "Stand at the cable station with your feet shoulder width apart and with a slight bend at the knee. Grasp the rope with both hands and your palms facing inward. Keeping your core strong and your elbows fixed at your sides pull the rope towards the top of your chest (only the lower portion of your arms should be moving). Tense your biceps at the peak, and then slowly allow the rope to be pulled back down to the starting position.",
