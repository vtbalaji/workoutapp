  "description": "Begin the movement by stepping on to a resistance band with your feet at shoulder-width, toes pointed slightly out. Bring your hands to your shoulders, keeping the handles of the band behind your shoulders. Brace your core and keep your chest up. Bend first at the knees then at the hips. Be sure to keep the chest up and abdominals tight. There should be no arch in your back. Pause when your thighs are parallel with the floor, then slowly return to the starting position, feeling the tension from the band in your quadriceps.",
