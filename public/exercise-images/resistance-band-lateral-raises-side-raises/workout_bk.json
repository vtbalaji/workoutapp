  "description": "Place your left foot onto the middle of a resistance band. Step forward with the right. Tighten your abdominals and avoid arching your back. Maintaining a slight bend in the elbows at all times, slowly raise your arms up from the sides of your body. Be sure to favor the front as you lift. Once your arms reach parallel with the floor, pause, feel the contraction, and slowly lower back down.",
