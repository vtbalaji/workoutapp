  "description": "Place your feet shoulder width apart and using an overhand grip at a little more than shoulder width, hold a barbell in front of you. Your arms should be fully extended towards the floor, palms facing in towards your thighs. This is the start position. Exhale and raise or shrug your shoulders up in a slow controlled movement. Do not use your biceps to assist in lifting the barbell. Continue as high as possible then hold for a count of one. Return to the start position in a smooth movement, inhaling as you do so. Pause then repeat. You can rotate your shoulders when performing this exercise. However this is not recommended for people with shoulder problems.",
