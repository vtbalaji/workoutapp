  "description": "Place a resistance band around your legs, at the base of your thighs, just above your knees Gently grip the chair seat under your thighs if this feels more comfortable for you. Keeping your feet grounded, move your legs away from each other at a controlled rate Continue doing so until you’ve extended the distance between your knees by 6 – 8 inches and then control the pressure as you bring you legs back together.",
