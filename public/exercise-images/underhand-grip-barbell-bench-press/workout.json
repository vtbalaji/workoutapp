  "description": "Lie down on a flat bench with a barbell positioned at an appropriate height above you. Using an underhand grip, place your hands at or just outside of shoulder-width. Brace your core and keep your upper back flat against the bench. Push the barbell directly up. Once secured, slowly lower it towards the chest. Make sure that your elbows do not flare out. Focus all of the tension in the chest. Once the barbell is near your chest, pause and push the bar back up to the starting position.",
