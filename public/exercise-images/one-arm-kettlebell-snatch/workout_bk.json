  "description": "Place a kettlebell between your feet. Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder width apart. Bend your knees and push your hips back,bending at the waist while keeping your back straight. Grip the kettle bell with an overhand grip. Keeping your neck and head straight, swing the kettlebell back between your legs. Once the kettlebell is behind you, immediately reverse the direction and drive forward with your hips and knees, forcing the kettlebell upward. When the kettlebell reaches shoulder level, rotate your hand and push straight up, using your momentum. Use your body’s downward momentum to receive the weight as it comes back down.",
