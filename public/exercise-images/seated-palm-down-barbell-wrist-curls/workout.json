  "description": "Place your feet flat on the floor, at a distance that is slightly wider than shoulder width apart. Leaning forward, rest the back of your forearms on your upper thighs and your palms facing down. The front of your wrists should lie on top of your knees. This is the start position. Lower the bar past your knees as far as possible by bending your wrists only. Keep your forearms flat on your thighs. Hold for a count of one. Now curl the bar upwards continuing past the start position as far as possible using your wrists only. Hold for a count of one while squeezing your forearms. Repeat the entire movement for the desired number of repetitions. This exercise can be performed using one or two dumbbells or an EZ bar.",
