  "description": "Begin by sitting on a flat bench. Hold the dumbbell at your side with an overhand grip. Tighten your core and flatten your back. Bring the dumbbells up to shoulder height so that your palm are facing you. Push the dumbbells overhead. Rotate them as you do so. At the height of the movement, your palms should be facing away from you. Pause, contract and slowly return to the starting point through the same rotation.",
