  "description": "Lie face up with your legs straight and a swiss ball between your ankles. Raise your shoulders and head slightly off the floor and keep your arms reached down at your sides with hands hovering just off the floor, palms facing down. Engage your abs, squeeze your inner thighs and ankles into the ball and lift your legs up to a 45-degree angle. Slowly lower the ball down until it gently touches the floor.",
