  "description": "Lie face down on a mat, with your arms fully extended above your head and your legs fully extended behind you. Lift your chest, arms and legs off the floor by arching your back. Only the tops of your quads and your lower abdomen should be in contact with the floor. Hold for a count of 2 while squeezing your abdominals and obliques. Return to the starting position for a count of one, then repeat. This exercise can be done using one arm and it's opposite leg at a time. For example, right arm and left leg raised while your left arm and right leg remain on the floor. This method of execution allows you to use the free hand to push down on the floor to lift your chest higher from the ground.",
