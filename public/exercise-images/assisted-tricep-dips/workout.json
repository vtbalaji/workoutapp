  "description": "Begin by using the weight stack to offset your bodyweight on an Assisted Dip machine. Now, position your knees securely on the padded surface while holding on to the bars on either side of you. Before lowering yourself, make sure that your core is tight and that your elbows are pointing directly behind you. Slowly, lower yourself until your upper arms are parallel with the floor. Push yourself back to the starting position and squeeze your triceps at the top. Lower yourself again slowly for the next repetition.",
