  "description": "Standing under a pull-up bar, reach up and hold onto the bar with an overhand grip. Make sure your hands are wider than shoulder width apart. Keep your arms straight and hang from the bar so that your arms are taking all of your weight. Keeping your body straight while not swinging your weight, drive your scapulae (shoulder blades) downwards allowing your body to lift 2 – 3 inches upwards. You should feel a “squeeze” in your upper back here. Then, slowly lower your body back down to the starting position.",
