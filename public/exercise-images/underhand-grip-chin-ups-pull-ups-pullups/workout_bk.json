  "description": "Standing under a pull-up bar, reach up and hold onto the bar with an underhand grip. Make sure your hands are about shoulder width apart. Keep your arms straight and hang from the bar so that your arms are taking all of your weight. Keeping your body straight and not swinging your weight, pull your body up towards the bar by pulling your elbows down towards your ribcage. Continue lifting until your chin reaches the bar level. You should feel a “squeeze” at the base of your lats (about midway down your back and to the side) and your biceps as they contract. Once your lats have completely contracted at the top of the movement, slowly lower your body to the starting position.",
