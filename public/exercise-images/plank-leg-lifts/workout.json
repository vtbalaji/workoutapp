  "description": "Lie on a mat and position yourself in a plank position. Place your elbows on the floor beneath your shoulders. Your toes should touch the floor and your torso should be lifted in a straight line. Engage your core muscles and lift one foot off the floor. Keep the rest of your body as still as you can. Your heel should lift until it is in line with your buttocks. Slowly lower the leg to the starting position and repeat with the other leg.",
