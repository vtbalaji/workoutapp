  "description": "Place a firm grip on an appropriately weighted plate. Before driving the plate above your head, make sure that your core is tight, your chest is up, and your grip is solid. Push the plate straight above your head, locking out your elbows. Once you feel stabilized, slowly bend the knees and drive your hips backwards, maintaining a tight, solid core as you do so. Once your upper thighs become parallel with the ground, slowly push back up, returning to the starting position. Be sure to keep that plate fixed overhead throughout the entire movement. This, like all overhead weighted movements, should be performed in a controlled environment. Be sure to check the weight before attempting, if working with an adjustable dumbbell ensure all is locked tightly into place, and your hands are dry.",
