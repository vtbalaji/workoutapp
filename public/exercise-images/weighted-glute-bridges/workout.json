Bend your knees, bringing your feet towards your hips. Bring the plate up and on to your pelvic area. Tighten your core, flatten your back, and make sure your feet are firmly on the ground. Raise your hips up, creating a straight line from your head to your knees. Slowly lower your hips and repeat the movement.",
