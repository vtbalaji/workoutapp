  "description": "Hold a kettlebell in your left hand and bring it to the center of your body. Throughout this movement, be sure to keep your abdominals braced and your gaze straight ahead. Begin the movement by bending at the knees then driving yourself up as you pull the kettlebell up. At the top, rotate the wrist so the kettlebell flips to the other side of your hand. Bend at the knees again with a slight lowering of the hips then drive yourself back up to create momentum. Push the kettlebell straight overhead. Carefully bring the weight down and repeat.",
