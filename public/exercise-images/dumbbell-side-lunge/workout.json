  "description": "Begin by standing with dumbbells in hand at your sides. Place your feet hip-width apart. Take a big step to the right with your right foot, keeping your arms straight. Land with your heel followed by the rest of your foot and flex the right knee so that you lower your hip and body until your knee and hip are at a 90 degree angle. Keep your left leg only slightly angled. Return to the starting position by extending your right hip and knee. Once they are straight, bring your foot back in to a standing tall position.",
