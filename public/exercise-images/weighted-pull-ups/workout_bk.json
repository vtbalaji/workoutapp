  "description": "Carefully secure a weight belt around your hips. Stand below a pull-up bar. Reach up and secure your overhand grip. Brace your core. Begin the movement by pulling with your lat / middle back muscles to bring your body towards the bar. Once your chest nears the bar, pause to feel the contraction in your back then slowly lower yourself to the starting position. Do not lock out your elbows.",
