  "description": "Stand with a tight core and flat back. Stagger your feet just a little so that your left foot is in front and your right front is behind you. Bend your elbows and bring your closed hands to your chin, mimicking a traditional boxing stance. Begin by extending your right leg up, leading with your knee. Next, extend your foot out. Immediately, retract it back to the starting position. Repeat on the other side.",
