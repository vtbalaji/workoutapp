  "description": "Holding the handles of the resistance band, step on to the middle. Place your feet at shoulder-width with toes pointing forward. Tighten your core and keep your chest up. Bend your knees slightly and drive your hips back but NOT lower than your knees. Again, keep the chest up. This is the starting position. Forcefully contract your glutes, driving them forward. Do not just lean back. Your glutes should be fully contracted. Pause then return to the starting position.",
