  "description": "Place your feet at shoulder-width apart while keeping your chest up and your abdominals braced Optionally, you can use something to stabilize your squat, such as a chair or support beam Begin the movement by bending at your knees and lowering your body down towards the ground while driving your hips back as if you’re sitting in a chair Once you feel you’re around halfway to a full squat, pause, and then drive your hips forward to return to the starting position",
