  "description": "Lie with your back flat on an exercise mat and your feet resting on top of a Swiss ball. Use your feet to roll the ball away from you until your legs are fully extended and your ankles are on top of the ball. This is the start position. Keep your shoulders flat on the ground and press down with your feet to raise your hips off the floor. Bend your knees, so that the ball is pulled towards you and continue as far as is comfortable. Hold for a count of one. Return to the starting position by extending your legs until they are straight.",
