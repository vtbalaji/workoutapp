  "description": "Hold on to the bar using an overhand grip so that your palms are facing forward. Lift the barbell off the rack by pushing up with your legs while straightening your torso. Step away from the rack and position your legs in a wider than shoulder width position and with your toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up and look straight ahead at all times, as looking down will put you off balance. Ensure your back is straight. This is the start position. As you inhale, slowly lower the bar by bending your knees while keeping a straight posture with your head up. Continue down until the angle between you upper legs and calves is slightly less than 90-degrees . As a guide, the front of your knees should be in line with your toes. Do not allow your knees to extend out beyond your toes. Hold for a count of one.",
