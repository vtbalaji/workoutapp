  "description": "Stand with your back straight, feet shoulder width apart, while holding a dumbbell in each hand with a neutral grip. Hold your arms fully extended by your side, with your palms facing in to your body. Keep your elbows close to your sides. This is the start position. Keeping your arms fully extended and your torso stationary, lift the dumbbells out to your sides and up until they are at shoulder level. Exhale as you do so. Hold for a count of one while squeezing your shoulder muscles. Return to the start position in a smooth controlled movement inhaling as you do so. <strong> </strong>",
