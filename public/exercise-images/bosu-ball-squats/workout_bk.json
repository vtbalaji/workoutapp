  "description": "Place a BOSU Ball on the ground with the blue rubber side facing up. Carefully, place one foot on each side of the rubber surface. Hold on to a stable surface while doing so, if need be. Maintain a straight back, tighten your core, and keep your chest up. Once balanced, bend at the knees and slowly drive your hips back. Lower your body to a comfortable level. Ideally, your thighs will be parallel with the ground. Pause at the bottom then contract your quadriceps and glutes to return to the starting position. Keep the knees slightly bent for the entire exercise.",
