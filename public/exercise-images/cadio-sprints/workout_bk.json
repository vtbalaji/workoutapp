  "description": "Hold your body steady in a solid, slightly-leaning-forward position. Drive your back leg into the floor and begin by taking small, rapid steps that gradually build to bigger, explosive steps. Pump your arms and use them to pull your body forward, allow your hands to travel from hip to lip as you run. With every stride, lift your front knee while straightening your back leg completely to deliver full-bursting power. As you pass the finish line, allow your pace to slow steadily. Do not try to stop yourself instantly, you have no air bag.",
