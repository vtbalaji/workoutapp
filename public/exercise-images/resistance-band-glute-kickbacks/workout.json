  "description": "Position yourself on the ground supporting yourself on your hands and knees. Hold the handles of a resistance band in each hand. Hook the middle of the band on your left foot, pushing it back until the slack tightens. Brace your core and maintain a flat back as you kick your left leg back and up. Slowly return your leg to the starting position, not allowing the knee to touch the ground. Repeat the movement.",
