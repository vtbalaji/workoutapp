  "description": "Lie on your back, either on a mat or comfortable workout surface. Bring your feet together, with your soles flat on the surface, and your knees bent pointing upwards. Bring your arms several inches away from your torso, keeping your palms facing up. When ready, lift one foot off the floor, bringing your knee a few inches closer to your chest. Repeat the motion with the opposite leg so that now both feet are slightly elevated. With the leading leg, gently lower your sole back to the floor, following with the opposite leg.",
