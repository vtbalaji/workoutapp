  "description": "Stand with your toes just underneath the bar at a shoulder-width stance. Keep your core tight and your back flat. Bend at the knees and hips. Lower yourself with your arms fully extended, your chest up and your gaze straight ahead. Take a firm overhand grip of the bar with your elbows running outside of your knees. Bring your knees in and shoulders up driving your hips forward. Keep the bar close to your body. Forcefully exhale and perform a full extension of the knees and hips. Use the momentum to bring your elbows high, then rotate your elbows around and under the bar. Rack the bar across the front of your shoulders. Press the barbell above your head to complete the rep. Please take absolute care with this advanced barbell movement.",
