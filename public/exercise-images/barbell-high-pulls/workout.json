  "description": "Prepare a barbell with a lighter amount of weight than usual. Place the barbell in front of you at your shins. Squat down into position, driving your hips back. Keep your chest and head up. Place your hands in an overhand grip on the barbell. Your arms should be straight with a slight bend at the elbow. In one fluid motion, explode up and off the ground as you pull the bar high, leading with your elbows. Your feet will leave the ground. Land softly and lower yourself back to the starting position.",
