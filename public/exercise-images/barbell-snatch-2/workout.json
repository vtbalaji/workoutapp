  "description": "Stand over a barbell with the balls of your feet placed under the loaded bar slightly wider than hip width apart. Squat down and take hold of the bar with a very wide grip; ensure that your shoulders are positioned above the barbell, keeping your back straight and eyes straight ahead. Explosively lift the bar by extending your hips from the squatting position and allow the bar to travel along the front of your legs. As the bar reaches your hip level, shrug your shoulders and pull the barbell upwards keeping the same line of trajectory if viewed from the side. Bending your elbows and allowing the bar to extend overhead, squat your body below the bar so that your position is squatted with your arms fully extended above your head. Maintaining a solid grip on the now overhead bar, drive your feet into the floor and rise upwards from the squatting position to complete the lift. This exercise is a complicated Olympic lift. If attempting for the first time, start with a light barbell or a broomstick for form practice. Ideally, do so with a qualified trainer present.",
