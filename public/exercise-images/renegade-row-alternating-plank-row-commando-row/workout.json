  "description": "Place two dumbbells or kettlebells on the floor about shoulder width apart. In a push up position, place your hands on the grip section of each bell for support. Spread your legs to slightly wider than hip width apart with your toes supporting your weight. This is the start position. Push down through one bell and at the same time “row” the opposite one upwards by retracting your shoulder and bending your elbow. Hold for a count of one. Your breathing should remain constant throughout the movement. Lower the bell to the floor and without pause, then repeat the movement with your other arm. When you have rowed both arms, that is one repetition.",
