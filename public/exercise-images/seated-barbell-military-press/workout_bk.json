  "description": "Inhale and slowly lower the bar down to shoulder level in a straight line. Hold for a count ofone while squeezing your triceps and shoulder muscles. Exhale and push the bar back up to the start position. To lessen the stress on your rotator cuffs, you can use a spotter to hand you the barbell when starting this exercise. This exercise can be performed standing. However, for people who suffer lower back problems, it is better to perform the seated version. This exercise can be performed by lowering the bar behind your neck,however it's not recommended for people with shoulder problems as it hyper extends the rotator cuff.",
