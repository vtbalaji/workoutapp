  "description": "Attach a resistance band to a door frame or other stable surface. The base of the band will come to the level of your knees/thighs. Holding each handle, turn away and walk forward. Take a left leg lead stance. Brace your core as you slowly push the resistance bands in front of you. Do not lock out the elbows. Slowly return to the starting position, focusing the tension in the chest. Once your elbows are at a 90 degree angle, pause and begin again.",
