  "description": "Hold a kettlebell with both hands in an over hand grip. Stand straight, with your legs slightly wider than shoulder width apart. Lean forward at your waist slightly and bend your knees as if getting ready to squat. Keep your back arched and your head facing forward. Let your arms hang loosely. Swing the kettlebell back between your legs while exhaling. In an explosive movement, force the kettle forward and back up in front of you, either to eye level or above head height by thrusting forward with your hips and rotating your shoulders. Continue for the desired number of repetitions or time.",
