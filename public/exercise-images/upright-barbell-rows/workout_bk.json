  "description": "Stand with your back straight, holding a barbell with an overhand grip slightly less than shoulder width apart. The bar should be level with the tops of your thighs. Keep your arms extended with a slight bend at the elbows. This is the start position. Exhale and using the sides of your shoulders lift the bar. As you do so, raise your elbows up and out to the side. Keep the bar close to your body as you raise it. Continue  lifting the bar until it is just below your chin. Pause for a count of one. Return to the start position in a single smooth movement. Inhale as you do so.",
