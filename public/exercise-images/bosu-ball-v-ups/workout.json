  "description": "Place a BOSU Ball on the ground with the blue rubber side facing up. Carefully, sit yourself in the middle of the BOSU Ball and place your hands behind you for balance. Bring your legs together and extend them in front of you. Contract your core and bring your feet off the ground. This is the starting position. Slowly, bring your feet toward the ceiling and your upper thighs toward your body. Pause at the top of the movement. Your body will form a “V” shape. Focusing on the contraction, lower your legs but do not allow them to touch the floor.",
