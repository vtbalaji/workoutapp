  "description": "Lie on the ground with a TRX Suspension Strap at your feet. Lift both your feet into the strap, making sure they are secure. Tighten your core and place your hands at your sides. Drive your hips up while maintaining a straight line with your body. Curl your feet in, moving them towards your butt. Maintain balance with your hands on the ground. Once your feet reach your butt, slowly extend your feet back to the starting position. Do not allow your hips to drop. Contract the core during the entire movement.",
