  "description": "Standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, grab a pair of TRX bands and hold them above your head. Keep your lower back straight and core tight. Keeping your gaze straight ahead, bend at the knees first and slowly lower your hips. Make sure you keep your arms above your head during the entire movement. Once your thighs are parallel with the ground, slowly return to the starting position, keeping a slight bend in the knees and the arms above the head.",
