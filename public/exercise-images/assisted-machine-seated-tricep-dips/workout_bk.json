  "description": "Sit at the Triceps Dip machine but make sure to brace your core throughout the movement. Place your hands on the bar with your elbows pointing behind you. Your arms will make a 90 degree angle. Slowly push down on the bars, focusing all the movement in your triceps. When you reach the bottom, pause and do not lock out your elbows. Slowly return to the starting position but do not let the weight touch the stack.",
