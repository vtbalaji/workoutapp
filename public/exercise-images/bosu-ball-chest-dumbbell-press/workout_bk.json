  "description": "Begin by sitting on the floor with your lower back against the side of the Bosu ball, and with the dumbbells resting on your upper thighs. Lower yourself back onto the Bosu ball while bringing the dumbbells onto your chest. Naturally you should create a straight bridge from your knees to your shoulders. Extend the dumbbells upward so that they are directly above your chest. Without locking your arms, place your hands in a horizontal position. Lower the the dumbbells towards your chest, imitating a slow-falling motion, until they reach the nipple line. Contract your chest to drive the dumbbells back upward to the starting position. Do not perform if you have back problems or injury.",
