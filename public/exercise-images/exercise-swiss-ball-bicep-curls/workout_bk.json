  "description": "Holding a pair of dumbbells, carefully sit down on a Swiss ball. Make sure that you are positioned in the middle of the ball and that you are balanced. Starting with the dumbbells lowered near the floor, put a slight bend in the elbows and maintain throughout. Keep your upper arms at your sides. Begin by lifting the dumbbells up and towards your chest. The tension should be exclusively in the biceps. Pause at the top and slowly lower. Again, do not lock out your elbows. Repeat.",
