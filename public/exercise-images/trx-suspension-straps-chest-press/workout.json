  "description": "Holding the handles of the TRX band, walk forward until the slack tightens. Brace your core and stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Now lean forward on the bands until the bands are supporting your weight. Maintaining a flat back and tight core throughout, lower yourself down between the bands until your elbows are at a 90 degree angle. Push yourself back up to the starting position.",
