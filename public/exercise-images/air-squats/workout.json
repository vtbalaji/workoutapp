  "description": "Place your feet at shoulder width apart while keeping your chest up and your abdominals braced. Begin the movement by swinging your arms up towards your shoulders. At the same time, bend at the knees and drive your hips back like you’re sitting in a chair. Once your upper thighs are parallel with the ground, pause, then drive your hips forward to return to the starting position.",
