  "description": "Begin by sitting on a bench or chair and elevate one leg while keeping the other foot, grounded and steady, on the floor. Place your arms straight out in front of you, and lean slightly forward to transfer your body weight onto your grounded foot. Using a combination of glute, quadricep, and hamstring strength, lift your body up to standing position. Stand strong, briefly, before lowering yourself steadily back to the seated position.",
