  "description": "Lie on a flat bench holding a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip. Start by holding the dumbbells slightly wider than shoulder-width apart above your shoulders. Your palms should be facing forward. Keeping your right arm stationary, slowly bend your left elbow until it reaches a 90-degree angle and your upper left arm is parallel to the ground. Push the weight back up by contracting your chest and straightening your arm. Repeat the same motion with your right arm while now keeping your left arm locked in position.",
