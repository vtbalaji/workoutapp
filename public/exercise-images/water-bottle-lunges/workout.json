  "description": "Holding a water bottle in each hand, stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Keep your shoulders back. And your back straight. Take a long stride forward with your right leg. Your right foot should be in a position, that when you bend your right knee, your upper and lower leg form a 90-degree angle. Slowly bend both your knees, to lower your hips until your left (rear) knee is just above the floor. Hold for a count of one. Return to the start position by slowly straightening your legs and raising your body back to a standing position. Complete all the repetitions for one set full set, then switch legs, or you can alternate between legs for each rep.",
