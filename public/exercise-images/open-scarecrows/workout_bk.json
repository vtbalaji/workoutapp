  "description": "Stand strong, with your feet grounded placed at shoulder-width apart, while maintaining a tight core and flat back, pull your arms out and upwards away from your sides, leading with your elbows. Pause when your upper arm is parallel with the floor, and your hands are hanging down towards the floor with a 90-degree bend at the elbow joint. Slowly rotate your upper arm bringing your hands forward, keeping the same angle bend at the elbow. Continue to rotate bringing your hands up so that they are above your shoulders and next to your head. Pause and then slowly return to the starting position.",
