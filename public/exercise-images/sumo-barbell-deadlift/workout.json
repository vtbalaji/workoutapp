  "description": "Place a loaded barbell in front of you. Position your feet wider than shoulder width. Have your toes pointing out away from the body. Tighten the core and straighten the lower back. Bend at the knees, lowering your hips down above parallel. Take hold of the barbell with an overhand grip at shoulder width. Focusing the tension in your hamstrings, pull the barbell up. Be sure to keep the barbell close to your body. Drive your hips forward at the top of the movement. Slowly reverse the movement and lower the barbell while maintaining a flat back.",
