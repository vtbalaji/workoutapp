  "description": "Place a BOSU Ball on the ground with the blue rubber side facing down. Carefully, place a hand on each side. Take a push-up position by ensuring your elbows are slightly bent, your core is tight and your hips are level. Bend at the elbows first, slowly lowering your body towards the BOSU Ball. Keep your core tight during the entire exercise. Pause once your upper arms are parallel with the floor. Push yourself back to the starting position, making sure not to completely straighten your elbows.",
