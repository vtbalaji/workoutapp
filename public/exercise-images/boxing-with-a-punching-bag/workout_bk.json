  "description": "Place your feet with your front foot pointing towards the punching back, your back foot running perpendicular to your front foot (forming a T shape), and a slight bent in the knees. Bring your hands to your face with your forward hand at jaw level, your back hand at ear level, and your elbows tucked in close to your body. Extend your front arm and make contact with the punching bag striking with your three knuckles that don’t include that of your index finger. Retract your forward hand to your guard position before striking the punching bag with your back hand and bringing it back to the guard position. You have just completed a jab – straight and should feel like a champion. Do not perform if you have had recent wrist injuries.",
