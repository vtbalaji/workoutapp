  "description": "Curl the bar in towards your chin and upper chest in a single smooth arc. Hold for a count of one. Lower the bar by extending your arms back to the starting position. This exercise is designed to isolate and focus attention on the biceps. Therefore, resistance is stronger at the start of each repetition. So when you begin each repetition, don't explode upwards too quickly!",
