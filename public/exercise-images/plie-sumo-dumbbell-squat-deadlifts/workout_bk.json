  "description": "Stand up straight with a tight core and flat back. Position your feet wider than shoulder-width. Your toes should be facing out diagonally. Holding a dumbbell with both hands in front of you, look straight ahead and bend at the knees while driving your hips backward. Your knees should be following your toes in a diagonal line. Complete this wide stance squat by having your thighs come parallel with the ground. Pause and slowly return to the starting position without locking your knees.",
