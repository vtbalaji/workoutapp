  "description": "Place a loaded barbell on the ground so that the bar itself is raised about 6 – 12 inches from the floor. Take the barbell with an underhand grip and get into a push-up position with your chest directly above the bar. Bend your elbows and slowly lower your chest towards the bar, being sure to allow your elbows to directly pass your rib cage. Make sure to keep your body strong and straight. When your chest is barely touching the bar, contract your pecs and push your body back up to the starting position.",
