  "description": "Stand straight holding a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip. Hold the dumbbells in in front of your thighs with your palms of the facing your thighs. Keep your arms fully extended. This is the start position. Raise the left dumbbell out and upwards, while keeping a slight bend in your elbow. Your palms must always face down for this exercise. Continue raising the dumbbell until you arm is a little above parallel to the floor. Exhale as you are raising the dumbbell. Pause for a count of one. Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbell to the start position. As you lower the left dumbbell, begin to lift the right dumbbell, duplicating the movement. When both dumbbells have been raised and lowered in a cycle, that is one repetition.",
