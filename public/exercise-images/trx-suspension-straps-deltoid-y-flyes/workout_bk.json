  "description": "Secure a firm grip on a pair of TRX bands. Straighten your lower back and tighten your core before leaning back. Place your weight into your feet. Focusing the tension in your shoulders, extend your arms overhead. Keep your arms straight and continue pulling upward until your feet are completely flat with the floor. Reverse the movement, slowly bringing yourself back into a leaning position with a tight core and flat back.",
