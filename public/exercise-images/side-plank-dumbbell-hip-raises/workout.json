  "description": "Lie on your side on an exercise mat or comfortable workout surface. Fully extend your legs with one resting on top of the other. Place a dumbbell on your upper hip, keeping it in safely place with your top hand. Place the forearm of your bottom arm on the ground with your hand in a fist pointing away from your body. Your forearm should run perpendicular to your body, while your upper arm should be in line with your body. Lift your body off the ground and balance on your forearm and the lower side of your foot, while keeping your body in a straight line. Contract your abdominal muscles and relax your shoulders. When ready, slowly lower your hips towards the ground a few inches, before elevating them up past the straight-line level of your body. Repeat for the specified amount of reps or time.",
