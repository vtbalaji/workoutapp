  "title": "Overhead Water Bottle Squats",
  "description": "Place a firm grip on two water bottles. Before driving the water bottles above your head, make sure that your core is tight and your chest is up. Push the water bottles straight above your head, locking out your elbows. Once you feel stabilized, slowly bend the knees and drive your hips backwards, maintaining a tight, solid core as you do so. Once your upper thighs become parallel with the ground, slowly push back up, returning to the starting position. Be sure to keep those water bottles fixed overhead throughout the entire movement. This, like all overhead weighted movements, should be performed in a controlled environment. Be sure to check the weight before attempting.",
