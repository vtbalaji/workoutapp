  "description": "Place a barbell in a clear space on the floor. (Make sure there are no obstructions in your way. Stand facing the barbell with your legs about 4-6 inches from the bar. Place your feet shoulder width apart.Your feet can be pointed straight ahead or turned outwards slightly. Squat down, keeping your back straight and grip the bar with an overhand grip at shoulder width. Keep your arms fully extended and stand up with the barbell. As you lift the barbell, your hips and shoulders should rise together and your back should be straight. As you reach the top of the lift and are standing straight, rotate your shoulders back slightly until you feel a slight stretch in them. Lower the barbell back to the floor in the same squatting motion you used to lift it.",
