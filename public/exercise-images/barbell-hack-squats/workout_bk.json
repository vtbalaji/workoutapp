  "description": "Begin by placing a loaded barbell behind you. Place two 25 lb plates under the back of your feet. Tighten your core and straighten your lower back. Slowly squat down, getting a good grip on the barbell behind you. Check to make sure your posture is still perfect and balanced. Stand up while holding the barbell behind. Use your heels to drive yourself back up. Do not straighten your knees at the top. Slowly lower yourself back down, driving your hips behind you. Repeat the movement.",
