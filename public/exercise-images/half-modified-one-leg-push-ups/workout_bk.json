  "description": "Place your hands on the floor, slightly wider than shoulder width apart. Like a modified push up, have your knees bent and on the floor so that your body is ready to perform a modified push up. Lift your right knee from the floor and extend that leg so that it points out behind you. Holding this position, lower your body towards the floor and then push yourself back up to the starting point. Complete the designated number of reps, before repeating the same motion with the left leg extended.",
