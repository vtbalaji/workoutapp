  "description": "Stand tall while holding a pair of dumbbells at your sides with an overhand grip. Your feet should be at shoulder-width. Tighten your core and carefully step forward with your left leg. Bend the left knee forward while dropping the right knee towards the ground. Once your left thigh is parallel with the ground, pause and contract the hamstrings. Keep your upper arms at your sides as you curl the dumbbell up and towards your shoulder, and rotate them into a hammer position. Slowly lower the dumbbells then kick off the floor with your left foot to return to the starting position. Repeat on the right side. Continue alternating.",
