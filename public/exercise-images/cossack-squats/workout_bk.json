  "description": "Stand tall with a tight core and make sure your feet are wider than shoulder-width apart (a sumo-like stance is ideal). Bring your hands together for balance if necessary. Bend your left knee and lower your body down towards your left knee as you sink your hips directly down towards the ground. Continue to lower your body, keeping your hips squared off to the front. As you get to your lowest point, allow the toes on your right foot to turn upwards, increasing the stretch along the back of your right leg. Contract the left hamstring muscle then push off the ground to return to the starting position. Repeat on the right side.",
