  "description": "Safely secure a pair of suspension straps. Hold a handle in each hand then raise both of your arms above your head. Keep your elbow slightly bent. Lean forward with a tight core. Bend your arms to allow your body to lean. Slowly push your arms forward, straightening them and raising your body as you do. Once your arms are extended with a slight bend in the elbow, slowly return to the starting position and repeat.",
