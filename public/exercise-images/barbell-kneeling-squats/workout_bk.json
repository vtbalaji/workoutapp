  "description": "In a power rack, set the barbell to where your shoulders will be when kneeling. Set up behind the barbell. Kneel on a padded surface. Place yourself underneath the barbell, positioning it across your shoulders. Tighten your core and drive your glutes forward as you lift the barbell from the rack. Slowly sit back, keeping a braced form with your upper body. When your butt touches your calves, drive your glutes forward again as you slowly return to the starting position. Repeat.",
