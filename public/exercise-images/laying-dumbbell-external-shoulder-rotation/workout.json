  "description": "On a mat or comfortable surface, lie on your left side, with your knees comfortably bent, and place your left hand behind your head creating a cushion for your head with your elbow crease. Place a light dumbbell just in front of your stomach. Lay your right elbow on your side and allow your forearm to rest relaxed across your stomach. When ready, grasp the dumbbell with your right hand, and exhale as you elevate your forearm away from your stomach while keeping your elbow loosely locked at your side. Continue to elevate your forearm until the dumbbell is in line with your body. Slowly lower your forearm back to the starting position to complete one rep.",
