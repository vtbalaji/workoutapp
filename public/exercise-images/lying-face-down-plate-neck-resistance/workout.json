  "description": "Holding a weight plate behind your head, lie face down on a flat bench so that your whole body is supported. Make sure that your shoulders are past and raised a little off the end of  the bench. Lift your upper chest, neck and face off the bench slightly. This is the start position. Holding the plate in position on the back of your head, slowly lower your head down over the edge of the bench (like nodding “yes”). Return to the starting position. Hold for a count of one. Do not use your hands to pull your head down or use a jerking motion when returning to the start position.",
