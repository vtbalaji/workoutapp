  "description": "Stand with your feet at shoulder width apart and lift your left leg off the floor, pointing it behind you. Bent your right knee slightly and then push through the floor explosively to allow your body to hop from the ground. As you land, be sure to cushion the impact by once again bending your right knee. Repeat for the designated number of reps before changing sides. Alternatively, continue hopping in a straight line for the designated distance.",
