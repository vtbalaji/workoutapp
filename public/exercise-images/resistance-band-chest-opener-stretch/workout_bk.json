  "description": "Stand strong, with your feet grounded and placed shoulder-width apart while maintaining a tight core and flat back. Take a firm grip of your resistance band at each end and elevate your arms to hold it horizontal straight out in front of you. Brace your core and lift both hands up and above your head in an arc motion. Keep your arms completely straight throughout. Slowly move the band behind you, focusing on the stretch in the shoulders. Hold the stretch for the specified amount of time before slowly returning to the starting position.",
