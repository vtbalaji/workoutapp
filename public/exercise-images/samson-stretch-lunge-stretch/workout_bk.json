  "description": "Begin by standing tall with a tight core and looking straight ahead. Keep your chest up as you step forward with your right foot into a lunge position. Lower the left knee to the ground. Extend the right knee forward. Clasp your hands together and push them straight overhead. You’ll primarily feel the stretch in your hamstrings and hip flexors. Hold for 20 to 30 seconds then switch sides.",
