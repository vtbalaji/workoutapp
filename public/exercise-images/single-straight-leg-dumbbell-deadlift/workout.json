  "title": "Single / One Straight Leg Dumbbell Deadlift",
  "description": "Stand tall with a tight core while holding a pair of dumbbells. Keeping your chest up and your gaze straight ahead, shift all of your bodyweight to your left foot. Bend the right knee, allowing the right foot to lift off the ground. Maintaining a flat back, tilt your upper body forward. Do not allow the dumbbells to pull you down. Control your descent. Simultaneously, allow the right foot to counterbalance the shift in weight. Feel the contraction in your hamstrings and pause once your upper body is parallel with the ground. Slowly return to the starting position.",
