  "description": "Stand with your feet in a wide stance, with your toes slightly pointed outwards – like a sumo wrestler. Hold your hands together in front of your chest. Keeping your back straight, lower your body towards the ground by bending your knees. Bring your left leg in one step so that it lands next to your right leg. Take one step with your right leg away from your left leg so that you are now back to the starting position. Repeat the complete movement in reverse to complete one rep.",
