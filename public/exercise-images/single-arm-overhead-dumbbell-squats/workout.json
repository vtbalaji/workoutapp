  "description": "Place a firm grip on an appropriately weighted dumbbell. Before driving the dumbbell above your head, make sure that your core is tight and your chest is up. Push the dumbbell straight above your head, locking out your elbow, (if the dumbbell can’t be driven above your head without difficulty, it’s too heavy and needs to be reduced) Once you feel stabilized, slowly bend the knees and drive your hips backwards, maintaining a tight, solid core as you do so. Once your upper thighs become parallel with the ground, slowly push back up, returning to the starting position. Be sure to keep the dumbbell fixed overhead throughout the entire movement.",
