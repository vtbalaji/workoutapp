  "description": "Stand straight with your feet hip width apart, arms fully extended and your hands by your sides. Raise your left foot from the floor, extending your leg out in front of you. As you do so, raise both arms out in front of you in a smooth arc for balance. This is the start position. In a controlled movement, lower your body toward the floor by bending your right knee while pushing your hips back as if sitting down in a chair. Continue this downward movement until your right thigh is parallel to the floor. Hold for a count of one. Return to the start position by pushing down through your right heel and straightening your leg. Lower your arms to the start position as you do so.",
