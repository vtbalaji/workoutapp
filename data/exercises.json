Explosively lift the bar by extending your hips from the squatting position and allow the bar to travel along the front of your legs. As the bar reaches your hip level, shrug your shoulders and pull the barbell upwards keeping the same line of trajectory if viewed from the side. Bending your elbows and allowing the bar to extend overhead, squat your body below the bar so that your position is squatted with your arms fully extended above your head. Maintaining a solid grip on the now overhead bar, drive your feet into the floor and rise upwards from the squatting position to complete the lift. This exercise is a complicated Olympic lift. If attempting for the first time, start with a light barbell or a broomstick for form practice. Ideally, do so with a qualified trainer present.",

Return to the start position in a smooth, controlled movement while inhaling. Do not use momentum or swing your legs to perform this exercise. As your strength increases, you can rotate your pelvis forward at the top of the movement to engage more of your lower abdominal muscles.

Alternatively, you can place your feet up on a bench a few inches apart with your toes turned inwards and touching. Place your hands lightly on either side of your head. Keep your elbows in  so that they are parallel to your body. Push your back down flat into the floor to isolate your abdominal muscles. Gently curl your shoulders forward and up off the floor. Continue to push down into the floor with your lower back. Raise your shoulders about four to six inches only. Hold and squeeze your abdominal muscles for a count of one.",

Squat down and take a firm grip of the dumbbell; ensure that your shoulders are positioned upright, keeping your back straight and eyes straight ahead. Explosively lift the dumbbell by extending your hips from the squatting position and allow the dumbbell to travel along upward and close to your body. As the dumbbell reaches your hip level, shrug your lifting shoulder and pull the dumbbell upwards keeping the same line of trajectory if viewed from the side. Bending your working elbow and allowing the dumbbell to extend overhead, slightly squat your body below so that your position is semi-squatted with your working arm fully extended above your head. Maintaining a solid grip on the now overhead dumbbell, drive your feet into the floor and rise upwards from the semi-squatting position to complete the lift. This exercise is a complicated explosive lift. If attempting for the first time, start with a light dumbbell for form practice. Ideally, do so with a qualified trainer present.",

    "description": "Stand in front of a sturdy bench, box or other flat non slip surface that’s high enough that you must use that you have to use a lot of effort in order to jump up on top of it. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Bend your knees as if crouching or performing a squat. In an explosive movement, push through your feet to jump up onto the landing area. Make a soft landing by bending your knees as your feet touch down.You should land on both feet simultaneously. Step down and repeat. If you have difficulty landing in a balanced way, the platform may be too high. A variation for advanced athletes is to jump down backwards from the box. Only try this once you have mastered the basic form.",

    "description": "Place your hands flat on the floor shoulder width apart. Keep your back straight and fully extend your legs behind you into a regular push up position, but with your feet spread slightly wider than shoulder width. Your body should be supported on your toes and hands only. Keeping your arms straight, move your hands back towards your feet, until your back arches upwards and you are looking between your feet. (Your body should form an upside down “V” shape) This is the start position. As you slowly exhale, bend your elbows, so that your chest and body arc forward and your hips move towards the floor. As you reach the start position, continue the movement by arching your back and straightening your arms. This will push your torso upwards so that your head and chest raise and you are looking above you. Slowly inhale and push through your arms to return to the start position. Hindu push ups are sometimes referred to as Dive Bombers. However a dive bomber incorporates a traditional push up at the midway point of the movement. Beginners: You can perform this exercise in a modified push up stance. That is, with your knees on the floor so the movement is completed using mainly your upper body.",

Keep your arms straight and hang from the bar so that your arms are taking all of your weight. Keeping your body straight and not swinging your weight, pull your body up towards the bar by pulling your elbows down towards your torso at an angle. Continue lifting until your chest is nearly touching the bar. You should feel a “squeeze” at the base of your lats (about midway down your back and to the side) as they contract. Once your lats have completely contracted at the top of the movement, slowly lower your body to the starting position. By using a wide grip, your lats are doing most of the lift, rather than your biceps. It doesn't matter if you keep your legs straight or bent at the knees with your feet crossed. The important thing is that you do not use your legs to assist in lifting your body weight. As your strength increases, you can add weight by using a weight belt.",

Keep your arm fully extended downwards without letting the dumbbell rest on the floor. This is the start position. Curl the dumbbell forward and up in a smooth arc, contracting your biceps and exhaling. Continue curling the dumbbell upward until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbell is at shoulder level.  Hold for a count of one while squeezing your biceps. Return to the start position in a controlled, smooth arc inhaling as you do so. Do not swing the dumbbell down. Repeat for all the repetitions for that arm then switch and repeat the movement with your other arm. Throughout this exercise, only your forearms should move. This exercise can be performed standing in a bent over position. Here there is no upper arm support so it's important to ensure there is no movement or swinging of the upper arm. This harder version of concentration curls isn't recommended for people who suffer lower back issues.",

Your arms should be fully extended at shoulder width, with your fingers facing forward. Place the heels of your feet on the other bench. Keep your legs fully extended. Have a spotter place a barbell weight plate or dumbbell on your lap. This is the start position. Slowly lower yourself down by bending your elbows,until they are at 90 degrees or slightly less. Hold for a count of one. Return to the starting position by pushing yourself up using only your triceps to straighten your arms. Hold then repeat You will need a spotter to help you with this exercise. Trying to place the weight in your own lap once in position can cause instability and increase the risk of injury. Have your spotter remain with you throughout your set to ensure the weights don't slide off causing injury.",
